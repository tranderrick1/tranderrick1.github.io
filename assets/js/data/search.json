[ { "title": "Hacktober - SWIFT's Month of SCARE", "url": "/posts/Hacktober/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "swift", "date": "2022-11-02 00:00:00 -0700", "snippet": "This past October, SWIFT has celebrated the National Cyber Security Awareness Month by hosting what we call Hacktober! So usually here at SWIFT, we teach all sorts of topics ranging from Windows/Linux security to the basics of the CI/CD pipeline. For October in particular, we focused solely on hacking hence the name, Hacktober. I even got to lead my first SWIFT workshop regarding web applications. Between the 4 weeks, the first 3 would be led by one of the CPP CPTC “Kill Squad” members teaching some topic. The final week capped off with a really cool event called “SCARE” or SWIFT’s Crack Attack Root Event.The Calm Before the StormI knew that Hacktober was coming up and I really enjoy teaching topics related to offensive security. This would be a great opportunity for me to spread the knowledge. The only issue is that I have not given a formal presentation in a few years so, here goes nothing, right? The next question was, “What do I want to teach?”. List of topics to cover over the month: Topic Learning Goals Environment Metasploit Teach the basics of metasploit as well as basic reconnaissance and enumeration. 1 Linux host serving 3 vulnerable services. Webapp Teach the basics of website enumeration, tools, and overall methodology. Also include basic injection techniques. 1 Linux hosting an intentionally vulnerable website. Active Directory Teach common windows privesc as well as common AD attacks. 1 Windows domain controller with common AD misconfigurations. I figured that Webapp week would most likely be the most fun for me to teach. It has some pretty interesting attacks you could play with and is, well hopefully, easy enough to teach to beginners as well.The Birth of JimCoinTo get started, I needed a basic web application to work with. A fellow colleague of mine provided me with his Computer Science class’ final project. The website was named RedemptionNFT which hosted a platform for people to buy, share, and list NFTs. The webapp was written in PHP which is convenient as PHP is known to be easily exploitable. So, I started developing the webapp.The webapp had some nice basic functionality but I wanted more. Taking some pages out of HackTheBox, I wanted to implement some common website vulnerabilities that I dealt with. Vulnerabilities such as: Vulnerability Summary SQL Injection An injection technique based on improper sanitization of user input used to craft malicious SQL queries. Local file inclusion Unsafe file handling leading to exposure of local files. Improper access controls You aren't supposed to be here. On top of these, I wanted to also teach the basic methodology of attacking a webapp so I included materials going over the usage of Burpsuite, gobuster, and so on.As the site was nearing it’s completion, I noticed that the default currency that was being used, Etherium, was not going to cut it. We need something new, something that really expresses us as a group. Enter, JimCoin. JimCoin is just a fake currency made up by us as a parody of one of our members. The original owner of the webapp created a subdomain for the site called “Jimmy Flips” where you can click a button to flip a picture of our friend to gain JimCoin. Using these coins, you can now purchase NFTs.Presentation of the MaterialWeek 1Our first week covered Metasploit. The leader of our Kill Squad members on the CPTC team led this presentation. He covered topics such as how to scan for vulnerabilities using Metasploit and how we can use it to our advantage. To be honest, I didn’t realize how powerful metasploit was until he put it on full display.Week 2Alright so this is my week. This week we went over the basics of web application penetration testing and boy was that s journey. I prepared roughly 40 slides of pure information and I’m sure I put people to sleep. It was a very informational presentation but I tried my best to explain the joys of high level web application penetration testing.Week 3This week we covered how to attack Active Directory led by our third member of the Kill Squad. It was around this time that involvement from SWIFT tended to cease which really hurt us. Between us 3, we had to effectively run a whole month worth of teaching material. We were pretty short staved to say the least. Creating slides, study guides, and presenting the material is a hassle. Regardless, I did my best to facilitate the teaching process each week.The SCAREThe SCARE is the conclusive event wrapping up Hacktober in a fun filled event. Each week we released an environment for the students to test the attacks we went over during each week and now, they get to see them all over again. The SCARE consists of 3 machines with the goal of each student attempting a penetration test on the boxes. The goal is to submit as many findings in detailed support tickets to the support desk to gain points. You get 100 points per foothold/privesc and 50 points per web vulnerability. We had a decent turnout of people but boy, only having 2 people man the support desk is stressful.Tickets began pouring in and piling up. I tried my absolute best to respond to everyone’s ticket in a thoughtful manner, but with the overwhelming amount of tickets being submitted, that would prove to be impossible. On the bright side, it is nice to see so many students excelling at the event as they find a handful of vulnerabilities to report.In the end, my mentee ended up winning the event by a large margin. The second place had roughly 2/3 the amount of points he did. But aside from winners and losers, the real takeaway of this event for everyone is knowledge. The people who stuck around from the beginning of the month to the end of the event, they all learned a significant deal about penetration testing.ConclusionOverall Hacktober was a success, but we can definitely use some improvements. First and foremost, I would’ve liked some more help from my peers as I did notice people taking a step back as the CPTC Kill Squad took over the month of teaching. We are only 3 people and we can only do so much. This put a lot of strain on us and phew was it stressful.Aside from those issues, this month in particular, I really enjoyed teaching people. During the workshops, the workshop lead would be teaching materials and going along while the other 2 helpers would go around and make sure everyone is on the same page. As I went around explaining details, I clearly remember seeing light bulbs pop up inside the students head as the fog cleared for them. Being able to visibly see students connect the dots is a very nice moment for me. I really enjoy teaching these people who have similar interests that I do. If anyone is curious and would like to view some of the development process into the web application, I have my notes here." }, { "title": "HackTheBox - The Progression", "url": "/posts/HackTheBox/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "htb", "date": "2022-10-15 00:00:00 -0700", "snippet": "HackTheBox, or HTB for short, is a website that I have used to develop a general penetration testing methodology. The platform provides you with multiple intentionally vulnerable hosts with the intent for you to compromise them. Each machine is effectively a long CTF where you embark on a journey to exploit vulnerabilities to gain flags hidden on the system. Every system provides you with a unique environment designed to expose you to different attack paths in order to teach you without being redundant from an older machine.Trust The ProcessMy time with HTB can be split into roughly 3 distinct periods. My first stint was cut off by an egregious addiction to Genshin Impact, severely hampering my progress into cyber security as a whole. Upon a wake up call in late February, I set off to continue my HTB journey in late April. This period continued until I went on a vacation with my family. Within a month, I came back and grinded for the title of “Pro Hacker”. Period Progression Dates Testing The Waters Completed 3-4 boxes. Each took an ungodly amount of time. Sep 13 - Nov 6 Taking Things Seriously Completed nearly 40 boxes over the course of a month and a half. Methodology refined. Apr 23 - Jul 26 The Push For Pro Hacker Completed a chain of active hard boxes. Took a considerable amount of time. Aug 29 - Sep 11 Testing The WatersThe very first box I took on went by the name “Cap”. The mascot was a pirate with a face seemingly saying “Arghh”. The box is aptly named cap due to the intended path involving p.CAP files as well as certain binary CAPabilities. Despite the box only requiring roughly 3 steps and the fastest completion time being roughly 5 minutes, it took me over 12 hours to complete. I admit my method for learning was not the greatest and I don’t recommend people to bash their head similarly to how I did, but its what I did to learn. I remember staring at my screen for several hours at a time searching up the most random things in attempt to move forward. Funny story, I remember searching up “Port 22 exploit” following an nmap scan as if it would help me. The first handful of boxes took me several hours to complete just a few steps. It was demoralizing I will admit. After 12 hours I looked back and realize how few things I have done. It’s painful, but that sound that plays when you submit the root flag, boy does that fuel me for days.Taking Things SeriouslyAfter completing a few boxes of the current rotation, I felt confident enough to purchase a VIP subscription. With this I am now able to access all of the old retired boxes. I tried my hand at several of the old easy and medium boxes and quickly realized that during my head-bashing sessions, I actually obtained a very primitive penetration testing methodology. These old boxes would be completed with ease. I would stay up nights trying to complete as many boxes as I could in a day. The sun peering through my window would by my signal to go to bed. 12+ hours would shrink to 1-3 hours for these quick and easy boxes and pretty soon, I realized, “I should aim for Pro Hacker”.The Push For Pro HackerHTB gives out titles based on completion of the current rotation of boxes. The issue is, there is no telling of how good or bad the quality of these boxes may be. However, having completed 40 boxes told me that I might be ready for the challenge. And so I started, one by one clearing all of the easy boxes. Took a bit but that was not too tough.Then came the medium boxes. I would spend a handful of hours across these boxes. One in particular I was not even able to compete. A box named “Retired” dealt with a buffer overflow in which I have no idea how to perform on a Linux system. Luckily for me, the box was retired (haha) and replaced by a much more reasonable “medium” box. Upon completing all of the easy and medium boxes, I only need 3 and a half more boxes to gain the elusive title. Issue is, only insane and hard boxes remain.Taking my brother’s advice, I decide not to even consider any of the insane boxes as those would put me through utter hell. That leaves only hard boxes left. I did some background research to complete the easier hard boxes and really, they were just longer versions of an easy or medium box. Not too bad. The two boxes left in my way were “Carpediem” and “Vessel”. These two boxes were rated pretty highly by the community. Accompanying the high ratings were also the high difficulty ratings. Long story short, I managed to overcome the both of them to gain my title of “Pro Hacker”. The cost? Only about 50 hours over the course of 2 weeks. I have detailed writeups on my notes which I will link at the bottom of the page if you are interested.Changing GearsAfter obtaining the title, a couple of my colleagues along with my brother convinced me to move on from the platform if I wanted to continue my learning. While it is true that I learned a lot from HTB, I was also becoming comfortable. I was performing different attacks on each machine however, my methods and tooling were always the same. If I want to improve technically, I need to start reading into how XYZ works or prepare for OSCP/CTRO. Regardless of what’s next, I need to get ready for CPTC. Western Regionals are coming up.What I Have LearnedHTB built my technical skills to where they are currently as of the time of writing. I first got started with these boxes back in August 2021 but did not actually take it seriously until about April 2022. Within the 5 months I’ve taken the platform seriously, I saw my box completion times drop from around 24h+ to around 2-4h depending on the length and difficulty of the machine. I remember spending hours trying to detect and perform a simple SQL injection on a website but now its part of standard procedure. Every challenge along the way slowly became integrated into my bag of tools to toss at a lock in the future.One of my greatest takeaways from HTB is the importance of debugging. What really separates a lethal penetration tester from an average one is, in my opinion, their debugging skills. It’s one thing to be technically sound and know the ins and outs of an attack vector but that does not scale well in the grand scheme of things. Being able to use your current knowledge to adapt and overcome challenges through debugging the source of error within your method is much more important.I can recall a handful of times where I have gotten stuck at some wall where I am unfamiliar with the intended attack path only for my younger brother to swoop in and give it a shot. Despite me having full context of the environment up until that point, my younger brother can debug my source of error and solve the issue with lightning speed. I vividly remember him complaining at how bad my keyboard is as he stumbled across which keys he wanted to press. As I stare at the console, I can hardly keep up with his commands and barely understand what is going on. When I concentrate hard enough, I can see that he is trying to understand at what point is the attempt failing and what other options does he have? 95% of the time this process eventually leads to success and opens the path further into the environment. In short, debugging is a critical skill to have and the better you are with it, the more well off you are.How I Use HackTheBox NowadaysRecently I have moved away from HTB to focus more on other projects or competitions that I’m gearing up for (CPTC and RvB!). HTB is great for learning technical skills however it somewhat caused me to develop tunnel vision. HTB’s environments tend to have one answer and the unintended paths tend to appear from the age of the machine or are some crazy high level find that I wont ever reach. Instead of treating HTB as if it was a realistic environment, I now use it as more of a sandbox. Setting up my own home lab can be tedious so why not use publicly available ones to test attacks instead? It is a trade off customizability for convenience. One of these days I’ll set up my own home lab as that alone will teach myself plenty of things but for now I’ll be using the “prebuilt” environments on HTB instead. No longer is HTB a puzzle or game where I would derive a sense of accomplishment by figuring out the intended attack path, but rather I use it to learn about why certain attack vectors work at a deeper level. It’s fun to test new tools on machines rather than going in blindly to figure something out after several hours of head-bashing.My Personal NotesI’ve taken down the posts that were originally on this site. As I realized, the more boxes I do the more I’ll flood this page up. Instead I have decided to publicly host my notes on Notion instead and link it here. Also if anyone is interested in my cracked younger brother and what he is up to, check out his blog. Some pretty crazy stuff." }, { "title": "CPP Cyber Bootcamps 2022 - The Throw of the Year", "url": "/posts/CPPCyberBootcamps2022/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "cptc, ccdc, competitions", "date": "2022-08-27 00:00:00 -0700", "snippet": "CPP Cyber is the competition team here at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Only skilled individuals are allowed to make it onto the team and CPP Cyber helps you with that by hosting these rigorous bootcamps to teach you the skills necessary to join the team. I have participated in the bootcamp in the year prior however, I did not take it seriously and paid the consequences by not making it onto either of the teams. This year, I decided to change that and make at least one of the teams.The bootcamp is marketed to be beginner friendly but to be honest, it isn’t really. The bootcamps are quite difficult and require you to go above and beyond outside of the allocated training times. This bootcamp is not for the faint of heart.Prior to the SummerShortly after ITC and RvB took place on the same day back in April, my schedule was clear to study up for the bootcamps. I am very inexperienced when it comes to the field of cyber, but I have a keen interest in it. Most of the people on either of the teams have several years of experience. Heck even some of the people are working in the industry already. Meanwhile there’s me, barely managed to exit VIM a few weeks ago. I have a lot to do if I want to make any of the teams.HTB ArcI’ll keep things short so that I do not have to repeat myself so much from my upcoming blog post however, here is the short version. CPTC was my main priority so immediately I set out to get started in my hacking journey. I have primarily used a platform called HackTheBox. Their website contains multiple environments that are vulnerable so that players such as me can attempt to fully compromise the system. By the time the tryouts for the CPTC came around, I had completed just under 40 boxes. I would like to think that after all of that, I am slightly prepared for what’s next to say the least.I’m currently working on another blog post regarding my HTB journey so give that a read if you get the change to. I plan to fully flesh out my experience with HTB when I reach a nice ending point, so to speak.Bootcamp Officially StartsLuckily for us this year, the bootcamp was held in-person along with a hybrid component for our online zoom buddies. Bootcamp was held every Saturday from, if I recall correctly, 10am-4pm. 10am - 12pm was the time slot for CPTC and 1pm-4pm was for CCDC. I showed up in person every single week that I could and gave it my absolute all. In contrast to the previous year, I would actually pay attention to the presenters and not sleep. The only issue was that for CPTC, I already knew roughly 75% of the material that they were teaching. Another issue was that once CCDC started, I was solely focused on doing CPTC homework. CCDC topics were interesting but the homework was nothing short of brutal. Giving beginners one week to set up Wordpress on IIS among other hellish tasks is a crime. Many tears were shed while trying to manually set up PHP for the first time. Not mine of course.I had to cut the bootcamp short due to a family vacation. I missed most of the material from week 4-6 and my grades reflected that. Upon returning, my body was still in vacation mode and I was just on cruise control all the way until the tryouts. A little bit unfortunate but hey, I had my fun.The TryoutsCPTCCPTC tryouts were the first of the pair to roll around and boy was I more than ready. Prior to the tryout, I ran through the previous year’s environment and pwned it completely, from the inside out. Last year when I tried out, I’d say I completed about less than 10% of it. To say the least, I was extremely confident on the day of the tryout. The moment it began, I performed an nmap ping sweep to identify the hosts. 3 targets, the dot 3, dot 5, and dot 10. Quickly pull up tmux and split into 3 new windows each with 2 separate panes. One pane was for a quick full port scan while the other was for a service version and script scan. Within 5 minutes I already had my targets fully scanned. Within 1 hour, the Linux host was already compromised. Within the next hour both hosts have fallen. By the time I moved onto the third, I realized I made a fatal error. To replicate the infamous port 502, modbus for typical ICS software, the dev team made the final box purposefully fragile. My “-sVC” scan tore it down and rendered it inaccessible. That’s a big whoops! Totally didn’t cry myself to sleep for a few hours.The following day I went down to a friend’s house to dine on some nice A5 Wagyu steaks. Needless to say, my report was not shaping up. I got home and my fingers never left my keyboard. I wrote everything down as fast as I could, modeling my report after RIT’s 2020 global report. In the end, I got the highest report score of 77.5/100 clearing the second place score of 62. Most people got in the 20s-30s. The standouts got 50+. The scoring team was pretty brutal. But that is only half the journey, CCDC is next.CCDCAs for the more prestigious competition, you would think that I would try to take more care for it, but I was quite burnt out by then. Riding off my high of the results from CPTC tryouts, I couldn’t really care less for CCDC. I kind of just winged it. This past RvB, a competition hosted by SWIFT modeled after CCDC, a fellow competitor and I managed to get first place. As a team of 2 edging out every other team of 4, we were pretty well set off. Going into the tryouts, I fumbled the bag, HARD.There were some bumps during the tryouts such as I didn’t actually know my team number until half way into the competition. All the services that I thought was up was not actually up. I wasn’t in the top 10, I was straight up in the bottom 10. By the end of the scoring checks, I wasn’t even in the top half of the competitors. I utteraly flunked it.Since my younger brother was already on the CCDC team and one of the scorers, I was slightly eavesdropping on his room to get the results prematurely. I heard them say something along the lines of: “Oh he isn’t doing too well. Oh shit, his service points aren’t great at all, he’s not going to make it. Wait, put in the inject scores, let’s see. Oh? WAIT HE’S GONNA MAKE IT!? Put in the homework scores quick! Oh wait nevermind he’s out of the race.” My carelessness on the CCDC homework cost me my spot on the team. Oops! I’ll redeem myself next year.Looking ForwardAll in all, the bootcamp was an amazing experience. Getting to see my fellow competitors aiming for a spot on the team sitting side by side with me in the room was quite fun. Really got my blood boiling from all the excitement. The next major milestone in my journey now is the CPTC Western Regionals in November. Look forward to that post after CPTC is all said and done." }, { "title": "RvB Spring 2022 - A Duo Is All It Takes", "url": "/posts/RvBSpring2022/", "categories": "Blog", "tags": "swift, competitions, rvb", "date": "2022-04-18 00:00:00 -0700", "snippet": "Red versus Blue, more commonly referred to as RvB, is an event held by SWIFT every semester. During this competition, you, the player, can sign up with up to 3 other people to form a squad of 4. With your squad, you are given a network of X amount of boxes to secure and defend as an active red team attempts to break in and take down your services. Meanwhile all of this chaos is brewing, the manager of the event is also handing out tasks called injects. It’s pretty fun and I recommend people to take part in it if they ever get the chance.Team CompositionEntering RvB, I wanted to win first place. This was not my first rodeo and I wanted that first place spot. I’m fairly familiar with the competition as I’ve gotten the chance to participate in the Fall 2021 RvB along with 2 other mini rounds during preparation for NCAE. So here’s about how much thought I put into the team composition: Zero Looking back I should have been more careful when trying to put together a championship roster. The team I put together was pretty much just running it back with some of the people who I managed to reach out to first from NCAE. For the sake of anonymity, no names will be dropped.First one up on the block is my buddy I’ve been running things with for a bit now. He and I got our start into security at roughly the same time and through previous RvBs, hes always had my back. He covered the spots I’ve left open. He’s probably the teammate I trust the most since the beginning.Second person showed interest in learning, but when the competition rolled around, did not end up doing anything really. They got caught up with some technical issues and ended up watching what me and my partner were doing in an attempt to learn.The third teammate was just MIA the entire time. I’ve attempted to contact him multiple times, all of which were in vain. Nice.The team composition ended up looking a bit like: Team Member Role Responsibilities Me Captain Team oversight + Windows and business J Ops Team Linux security W Spectator Nothing A Bro was missing Nothing The PreparationAs much as I wanted to win, the fact that ITC, another competition, took place on the same day as RvB. Since I was more familiar with RvB, I dedicated most of my time up until that point into the other competition. I sort of winged RvB when it really comes down to it. All I really had were a few rudimentary checklists to follow. Regardless, I was confident enough when we entered the competition.The StrategyThe plan was pretty simple, do the basic defenses and just camp the leaderboard. As a team of two, its better to focus on the short-term solutions as long-term ones require too much attention and dedication. The competition went on for about only 5 hours which is not that long relative to CCDC so we would be better off in the short-term. Change passwords, firewall, set up an antivirus, and disable useless services. That’s all we really planned to do.The ShowdownAs we take our seats in the back of the room, the event coordinator, Abe Woz takes the podium. He gives us a speech regarding the state of the factory and how he is aware of an APT group planning an attack and that it was up to us to defend their network. Towards the end of the speech, he gets an emergency call and screams to us that we are under attack, signaling to us that that is our cue to begin the event.Immediately my partner and I divide up the work. He gets the 3 Linux boxes and I get the 3 Windows boxes. We did have a router that was also in scope but none of us knew how to configure a pfSense router so we just sat back and prayed nothing would happen to it. I secured the basics of my first windows box within 20 minutes as they were all just low hanging fruit. I had to rush since one of us needed to work on the business task that was assigned to us. My duo worked tirelessly and quickly to secure the remaining linux boxes.By the time I submitted the first inventory report, I had realized that none of us went up to do the presentation, costing us a severe loss in points. Too many tasks to juggle between just the 2 of us caused us to get lost in the sea of tasks. Regardless of the outcome, I continued working on my next task of the audit report.Snippet of the audit reportWhile working on the business side of things my partner noticed that after all that, we were barely outside of the top 3 in the event. With the high quality of our injects, I knew we actually stood a chance of winning the competition. Every time we saw one of our services go down, we would immediately try to trace the root cause of the issue and bring back up our service as soon as possible. Due to our quick reactions, we eventually cracked the top 3 in terms of service points.Some time during the event, we failed to notice that one of the red teamers swung by and stealthily took a picture of our screens. My partner conveniently had a text file with all of our passwords to the environment on it. The red teamer came by 30 minutes later and teased us in a roundabout way by asking these super specific questions about our password as he inched closer and closer to it with each subsequent question. It was a pretty funny moment when he revealed the pictures he had taken of us.The ResultsThe awards ceremony announced the teams who did best by category before moving onto the overall winner of the event. The 3 categories went as follows: Most Inject Points Most Service Points Most Overall Points (The Winner)The team that got the most inject points.. was not us. I was surprised as I was quite confident that our reports were really well made. The team that got the most service points was also not us. Things aren’t looking too great right now. My doubts were quickly suppressed as to my surprise, our team did win the most overall points.Despite only having a team of two members, we managed to defeat every other team of 4 in the event. A pretty nice crowning achievement if I do say so myself." } ]
